I created the Tindog website(frontend) as part of my training under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) program. This project allowed me to hone my web development skills and put them to practical use.

Tindog is a website that connects dog lovers, helping them find their furry friends and love for dogs.
